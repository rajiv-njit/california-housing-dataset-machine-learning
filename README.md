## California Housing Dataset Machine Learning Projects

### Source: 

This dataset is a modified version of the California Housing dataset, built using the 1990 California census data. It contains one row per census block group.

The dataset contains information on 9 variables collected from all the block groups in California in the 1990 Census. The dependent variable is the median house value.

This dataset is used in the book "Hands-On Machine Learning" by Aurélien Géron to demonstrate a sample end-to-end machine learning project workflow.
